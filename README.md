# PDF_Merger
 One day I needed to create one from many PDFfiles and then I spent about half an hour on it. So I created this script that allows you to merge multiple PDF files into one
# Instruction
Number the files so that when sorting the names in the folder in ascending order, they go in the order you need (for example: 1.pdf, 2.pdf, 2.pdf). Then move or copy all this files into "pdfs" directory
# For run it:
Enter into the terminal:
```
python pdf_merger.py
```
Or run sh script. If you cannot just run it, enter the coommand into the terminal:
```
sh pdf_merger.sh
```
