# PDF_Merger
 One day I needed to create one from many PDFfiles and then I spent about half an hour on it. So I created this script that allows you to merge multiple PDF files into one.
# Instruction for terminal version
Number the files so that when sorting the names in the folder in ascending order, they go in the order you need (for example: 1.pdf, 2.pdf, 3.pdf). Then move or copy all this files into "pdfs" directory.
# Instruction for GUI version
Run app. Select files in merge order. Merge it.
# If you use Windows:
Just run .exe file
# If you use Linux
Enter into the terminal:
```
python pdf_merger.py
```
```
python pdf_merger_GUI.py
```
Or run .sh script. If you cannot just run it, enter the coommand into the terminal:
```
sh pdf_merger.sh
```
```
sh pdf_merger_GUI.sh
```
